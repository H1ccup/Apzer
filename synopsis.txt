* This will be an api testing framework borrowing ideas from Mock, Nose and Apiary. 

* There are two ways in which you can provide your api to Apzer - 
	* You can either define a route schema, thas has your api endpoint, params required 
	and json/xml response

	* Or you can use the apz.route() on your views/controllers and register them as apis. 

* In both of the cases, you've to provide a json schema response if you want it to over-ride the response of your function

* This has been built so that it remains framework indepedent. Though it will be built around cherrypy, where it can act as a standalone server which uses your controllers as functions that return data after hitting a particular end-point. Or you can always pass your server instance to it and it will pop up on {{route_ur}}/apz when you start your server.
